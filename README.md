# Bank-Management
This is my first web project.Used Java for Servlets and Database Logic, developed in just four days for my web development course project.Includes session handling using JSP to prevent unauthorized access. It features basic admin and user functionalities .The system includes:<br>
Admin Page:<br>
<b>1.Add Bank User </b><br>
<b>2.Delete Bank User </b><br>
<b>3.Update User Data</b><br>
<b>4.Check Payments History</b><br>
Bank Customer Page:<br>
<b>1.Transfer Payments </b><br>
<b>2.Deposit Cash </b><br>
<b>3.Withdraw Cash</b><br>
<b>4.Check Payments History </b><br>
Login Page â€“ Directs users to the appropriate page based on their role (admin or customer), as defined in the database.
The database structure consists of three tables, with an ID as the primary key, to manage all functionalities efficiently.<br>
Applied Layers for seperation of logic.All the Database Logic is in personDAO
