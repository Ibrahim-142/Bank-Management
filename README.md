# Bank-Management
This is my first web project, developed in just four days during my web development course. It features session handling using JSP to prevent unauthorized access. The system includes:<br>
Admin Page<br>
Bank Customer Page<br>
Login Page â€“ Directs users to the appropriate page based on their role (admin or customer), as defined in the database.
The database structure consists of three tables, with an ID as the primary key, to manage all functionalities efficiently.
